# Heroku Model Deployment of Life Expectancy Prediction Model-Week5

This repository contains the necessary files like model.pickle, app.py, requirements.txt, Procfile, runtime.txt and a separate templates folder.

**model.pickle** - This is the linear regression model which is converted into a pickle file to allow deployment

**app.py** - Flask application required for model deployment

**Procfile** - This gives the process of how the Heroku app will run.

**requirements.txt** - This contains the necessary dependencies, i.e. libraries and their versions, which would be needed to deploy the flask app on Heroku.

**runtime.txt** - This gives the runtime version of Python used on the local machine.

**model.py** - This file contains the code of the Linear Regression model trained on the Life Expectancy data from WHO.

**led.csv** - This is the dataset from WHO being used for the model-building.

**Week 5 - API and Cloud based Deployment.pdf** - This pdf contains step-by-step process of the deployment of the Life Expectancy Prediction end-to-end model on the open source cloud platform called Heroku.

**Model Deployment on Flask.pdf** - This pdf shows the steps of creating a Flass application and how to deploy an end-to-end model (like the Life Expectancy Prediction model) on the app.
